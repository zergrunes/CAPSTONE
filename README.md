The Squirrel Census is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public.

On March 1, 2020 — with the help of 72 volunteer Squirrel Sighters, as well as NYC Open Data — they performed a sample count in 24 New York City parks, and gathered other material data. Four hundred and thirty-three squirrel sightings were tallied. The methodology was less focused on total squirrel numbers per hectare and more attuned to the stories — of squirrels, humans, and parks.
